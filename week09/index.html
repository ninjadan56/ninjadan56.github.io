  <div class="response">
  <p> The first article really made me think about how the internet changed as well as making me wonder about what direction it is taking now.
  The two things that interested me was the rise of ads and data management in Web 2.0 by Google. Also the idea of subscribing to a page for updates is something we don't really think of these days and just use, but it was developed with Web 2.0. Who own's this data that is on the Web is something that is very controversial.
  Something that stood out to me in the second article was how some softwares can create 3D images by crowdsourced photographs and how these software and programs can see things that humans might even miss. This is scary but also good in a sense that if there is a crime like a bombing in a crowded area where a lot of people are taking photos. We can use those photos to find suspects of the crime.
