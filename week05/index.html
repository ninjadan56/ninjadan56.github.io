  'Nerd,''Nonsmoker,''Wrongdoer': How Might A.I. Label You?

    Honestly, I think I got the message about AI and face recognition being biased. Like who the heck gets to decide what these programs identify people as. What right do they have? I don't think a lot of people know about this kind of bias though. I think I want to inform more people about this, especially since my friend did not know about the Imagenet website. AI face recognition is used in a lot places and potentially I think it can be harmful or can be used to mistreat certain groups of people.

    I took these pictures at work because I literally had no time to take pictures thursday before the site was shut down. Also the labels the AI gave me were so weird. I kept being identified as a woman. So I kept taking pictures to see if it would actually recognize me as a male.

    Imagenet first identified me as a beldam which is a woman of advanced age, as well as grandma, and a flibbertigibbet which is a female fool. Last picture I took I was identified as a pharoah.

    I took a webcam shot of my coworker at work, because he had never heard of Imagenet. I thought it was really funny because it wouldn't identify him as anything other than a mulatto("offspring of a black and white parent"). He is Malaysian, so I don't understand how LOL.

    Also I took some pictures from my friend's Facebooks and used them on the site. This was all during work hours. Let's just say I was on break.
