    Advice I recieved
  </p>

    I tried to use grids to align my images, but unfortunately it did not work as I intended the images to line up. Alex and Ashia told me that I should try using Flex instead. Maybe I should have considering I was more familiar with it than grids.
    Also I had some feedback on my nav bar. I wanted to have the images be kind of like a visual nav bar in which it would lead to the same pages as the nav bar in the header, but Kyra Lee and both Raeva suggested that I should instead have the images should stay as the nav and the nav bar should be mostly just a page to be about me and since it would be redundant to have two ways to navigate. I got the same response with Brian, George, and Ashley. Raeva also mentioned that I should try to use sound as it would beneficial for the webstie. I also thought the same because I wanted a page where it would help the user tune their instrument.
    I also got feedback on my font. Saying that it should be more friendly. I think I wanted to make it more like professional but I guess making a little friendly would be ok since this website isn't totally professional and I would like it to kind of be more like a blog.

    I want to try to make the navigation of my website better. I wanted to make a sandwich nav bar where it would pop out, but I tried it and it does not look nice without Javascript. I would like to try to do this without it for now since Professor Rebecca also said to try to use CSS and HTML.
    I would want the images to be related the page I want them to navigate to and all. Like for Famous Players I would want to have a famous pose that some bass player did, or for types of basses I would show different body shapes, and for lessons I would do a music sheet. I think that talking to my classmates really helped me to go through my thoughts clearly and pick out what I want the content of website to be. It also helped me to narrow my choices down and see how other people would view my website.
